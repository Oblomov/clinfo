.SH NOTES
Some information is duplicated when available from multiple sources.
Examples:
.IP \(bu 2
supported device partition types and domains as obtained using the
.B cl_ext_device_fission
extension typically match the ones obtained using
the core OpenCL 1.2 device partition feature;
.IP \(bu
the preferred work-group size multiple matches the NVIDIA warp size (on
NVIDIA devices) or the AMD wavefront width (on AMD devices).

.P
Some floating-point configuration flags may only be meaningful for
specific precisions and/or specific OpenCL versions. For example,
.B CL_FP_CORRECTLY_ROUNDED_DIVIDE_SQRT
is only relevant for single precision in OpenCL 1.2 devices.

.P
The implementation-defined behavior for NULL platform or context
properties is tested for the following API calls:
.TP 2
.B clGetPlatformInfo()
by trying to show the platform name;
.TP
.B clGetDeviceIDs()
by trying to enumerate devices; the corresponding platform (if any)
is then detected by querying the device platform of the first device;
.TP
.B clCreateteContext()
by trying to create a context from a device from the previous
list (if any), and a context from a device from a different platform;
.TP
.B clCreateteContextFromType()
by trying to create contexts for each device type (except DEFAULT).

.SH EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
.P
Support for OpenCL 2.x properties is not fully tested.

.P
Support for
.B cl_khr_subgroup_named_barrier
is experimental due to missing definitions in the official OpenCL headers.

.P
Raw (machine-parsable) output is considered experimental, the output format
might still undergo changes.

.P
The properties of the ICD loader will also be queried if the
.B clGetICDLoaderInfoOCLICD
extension function is found.

.P
Support for the properties exposed by
.B cl_amd_copy_buffer_p2p
is experimental.

.P
Support for some (documented and undocumented) properties exposed by
.B cl_amd_device_attribute_query
is experimental (see also
.BR LIMITATIONS ).

.P
The highest OpenCL version supported by the ICD loader is detected
with some trivial heuristics (symbols found); a notice is output
if this is lower than the highest platform OpenCL version, or
if the detected version doesn't match the one declared by the ICD
loader itself.

.SH LIMITATIONS

.P
OpenCL provides no explicit mean to detect the supported version
of any extension exposed by a device, which makes it impossible to
determine a priori if it will be possible to successfully query
a device about a specific property.
Additionally, the actual size and meaning of some properties are not
officially declared anywhere.

.P
Most notably, this affects extensions such as
.B cl_amd_device_attribute_query
and
.BR cl_nv_device_attribute_query .
Heuristics based on standard version support are partially used in the code to
determine which version may be supported.

.P
Properties which are known to be affected by these limitations include:

.TP 2
.B CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_FREE_MEMORY_AMD
documented in v3 of the
.B cl_amd_device_attribute_query
extension specification as being the global free memory in KBytes, without
any explanation given on why there are two values.
.TP
.B CL_DEVICE_AVAILABLE_ASYNC_QUEUES_AMD
documented in v3 of the
.B cl_amd_device_attribute_query
extension specification, but not reported by drivers supporting other v3
properties. This has now been enabled for drivers
.I assumed
to support v4 of the same extension.
.TP
.B CL_DEVICE_SIMULTANEOUS_INTEROPS_INTEL
exposed by the
.B cl_intel_simultaneous_sharing
extension is not reported, due to lack of knowledge on the possible
values the list elements can have.
